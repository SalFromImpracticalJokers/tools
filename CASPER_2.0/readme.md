This is the second release of my CASPER encryption algorithm. It features massive improvements over the previous design.
- It is usable as python library
- Utilises C++ algorithms for the 'intensive' parts of encryption absolutely demolishing the previous version in terms of speed
- includes far more robust key generation
- includes memory safe key storage
- 256 bit encryption default instead of 128
- built in compatability with unicode
